                        &emsp;Welcome to my website! I am a software developer and former Mathematician. I worked as a Mathematics instructor at the university level for over a decade. 
                        In 2020 I began my journey in programming. I started by learning SQL and Python. I wrote a few games in python and then moved onto learning about data visualization 
                        and statistical analysis in Python. After that I became very interested in software development and data science. I went through
                        a few modules online through <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/">dataquest</a> and then enrolled in We Can Code IT's C# bootcamp. 

                        I have been working for MRI software for almost 4 years and have learned a lot. During my time there, I have picked up more advanced SQL knowledge and have 
                        taken courses in machine learning and natural language processing. I came up with a new AI feature and built it into our codebase and was the main developer
                        on a new core client page. I have worked on two projects optimizing performance for loading
                        large datasets. I also mentored an intern and have led a training for new developers. 
                        
                        I am looking forward to continue
                        my software development path! 
                        
                        This webpage contains mostly projects completed while I was first learning how to code as well as my education background. You can find my resume <a href="/resume.pdf" download="Jesse_Feller_Resume.pdf">here</a>
                        which includes udated information about me.

                        &emsp; This is a C# console app that simulates dice rolling with simple graphics. Users start by picking
                        a dice color and specifying how many sides they want the dice to have. After that users can then 
                        roll the selected dice on a table and select which dice they want to keep and which ones they want 
                        to roll again.

                        &emsp; This is another C# console app where users interact with a shelter of pets. Users can add their own 
                        pets to the shelter and choose from the categories of organic or robotic pets. All pets in the shelter
                        will need to be taken care of via interactions (play, feed, take to doctor). Each pet has levels of 
                        health, boredom, and hunger that will deteriorate as time passes by if not taken care of. They will
                        start making alert noises if not taken care of properly. Interactions come with sound effects and text 
                        art. Finally, pets can be adopted out of the shelter.
